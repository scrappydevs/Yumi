# Yumi - AI-Powered Food Discovery

**Tagline:** Your personal food companion that learns what you love

---

## Slide 1: The Problem 🤔

### **"Where should we eat?"**

**The Modern Dining Dilemma:**

**Decision Fatigue**
- Average person spends 132 hours/year deciding where to eat
- Scrolling through hundreds of restaurants on Yelp/Google Maps
- Generic 4.5⭐ ratings don't tell you if YOU'LL like it
- Analysis paralysis: too many choices, no clear winner

**Group Dining is Broken**
- "I don't care, you pick" → 20 minutes of back-and-forth
- Sarah wants sushi, Mike wants burgers, Alex is vegetarian
- Compromise on mediocre places nobody loves
- Someone always ends up disappointed

**Memory Loss**
- "What was that amazing Italian place we went to last month?"
- Can't remember why you loved/hated specific restaurants
- No personal history of your dining experiences
- Generic saved lists don't capture the context

**The Real Problem:** Current apps treat everyone the same. Your taste is unique.

**Yumi's Edge:**
1. **Truly Personal**: Not "most popular" - what YOU will love
2. **Effortless**: Voice reviews take 10 seconds
3. **Group-First**: Solves the actual problem of group dining
4. **Context-Aware**: Understands "date night" vs "quick lunch"
