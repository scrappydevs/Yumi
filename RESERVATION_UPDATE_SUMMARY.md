## 🔗 Integration Points

### Profile → Reservation:
```typescript
// When user clicks message button:
router.push(`/reservations/new?inviteeId=${id}&inviteeName=${name}&inviteePhone=${phone}`)
```

### Reservation Form:
```typescript
// Reads query params and pre-fills:
const inviteeId = params.get('inviteeId')
const inviteePhone = params.get('inviteePhone')
setInvitees([{ phone: inviteePhone, profileId: inviteeId }])
```

## 📊 Database Tables (Minimal Setup)

Only 3 tables needed:

1. **reservations** - Core data
2. **reservation_invites** - RSVP tracking
3. **used_jtis** - Security tokens

SQL migration: `prisma/migrations/20250104_add_reservations_feature/migration.sql`

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run SQL migration** in Supabase
2. **Configure Twilio** credentials in backend `.env`
3. **Set frontend env**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`
4. **Test end-to-end**:
   - Create reservation from profile
   - Receive SMS
   - Confirm via link or SMS reply

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Create Reservation" doesn't work?**
- Check console for errors
- Verify backend is running on port 8000
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in frontend `.env.local`

**SMS not sending?**
- Verify Twilio credentials in backend `.env`
- Check phone number is E.164 format: `+1234567890`
- Check backend logs for Twilio errors

**Friend's info not pre-filled?**
- Check URL has query params: `?inviteeId=...&inviteePhone=...`
